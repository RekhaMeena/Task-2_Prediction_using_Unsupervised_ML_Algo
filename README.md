## Task-2-Prediction_using_Unsupervised_ML_Algo :

#### Problem Statement : From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

Language : Using the Python

Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

#### Model Building : k-means clustering method
The k-means clustering method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset.
Here the data is divided into several groups (clusters), data points in each group have similar characteristics.

#### Conclution : 
We have successfully created three clusters from our Iris data set. All data clusters are shown in different colors.
